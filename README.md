# Web3 Fullstack Starter Kit

This project is starter kit for developing Fullstack Web3 App (dApp).

It's a monorepo of Counter dApp, developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for Frontend and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for backend (contracts)

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` and get an output like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` And get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to install it with npm

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surajgjadhav/web3-fullstack-starter-kit

It contains two separate projects:
